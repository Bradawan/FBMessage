# FBMessage : Facebook Messages Vizualisation

Authors : [Mathilde Reynaud](https://github.com/MathReynaud)| [Augustin Durivault](https://github.com/adurivault) 

The goal of this project is to allow you to visualize your own Facebook Messages in your browser, with a nice graphical display that gives insights on when, to whom, etc... you send (or receive) messages. If you have always been curious about your Facebook messages
history, maybe you will find some answers here.

## How does it work ? 

### Create your datafile from your Facebook History
Just follow the instructions from the <a href="/DATA.md"> DATA.md</a> file and the <a href="/PROCESSING.md"> PROCESSING.md</a>, everything is explained. Once you got your data ready, you can go on the [website](https://mathreynaud.github.io). 

## Presentation video

There is a presentation [video] of this project, and if you are a little bit lost on how to use the tool, or how to get your data
you will theoretically find an answer here. 

### General design

If you go [here](https://mathreynaud.github.io) you will see that there is already some data on the interface. It is just there for
the demonstration and if you want to get familiar with the tool, or if you do not have any facebook account, you can
play with the demo data but this will not be very interesting, as everything is anonymous.

<table border="0">
  <tr>
    <td>
      <img src="img/1-presentation.png" style="width: 100px;">
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

But if you click 

## What will it look like ? 
[TODO]
