# FBMessage : Facebook Messages Vizualisation

Authors : [Mathilde Reynaud](https://github.com/MathReynaud)| [Augustin Durivault](https://github.com/adurivault) 

The goal of this project is to allow you to visualize your own Facebook Messages in your browser, with a nice graphical display that gives insights on when, to whom, etc... you send (or receive) messages. If you have always been curious about your Facebook messages
history, maybe you will find some answer here.

## How does it work ? 

### Create your datafile from your Facebook History
Just follow the instructions from the <a href="/DATA.md"> DATA.md</a> file and the <a href="/PROCESSING.md"> PROCESSING.md</a>, everything is explained. 

### Use your data in the web interface
We did not put any data in example, because it is private. But you can use yours !

## What will it look like ? 
[TODO]
