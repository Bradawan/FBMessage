# FBMessage : Facebook Messages Vizualisation

The goal of this project is to allow you to visualize your own Facebook Messages in your browser, with a nice graphical display that gives insights on when, to whom, etc... you send (or receive) messages. 

## How does it work ? 

### Create your datafile from your Facebook History
Just follow the instructions from the <a href="/DATA.md"> DATA.md</a> file and the <a href="/PROCESSING.md"> PROCESSING.md</a>, everything is explained.
