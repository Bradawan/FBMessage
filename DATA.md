# How can I access and transform my conversation history ?

## Create your facebook archive

Facebook allows you to dowload all of your data history, particularly your messages archive. In order to do that :

1. Go to your Facebook account
2. Then click on <b>"Settings"</b>
3. Click <b>General</b> in the lefthand column.
4. Click <b>Download a copy of your Facebook data</b> at the bottom of the General Account Settings page.

Then you have to wait for approximatly 10/15 minutes before receiving an email with a link to dowload your data.

Be patient! It can be long sometimes, up to a few hours. 

Once you have it, you can see that all of your conversation history is stored in ``messages.htm``.

In order to use it, please go see in [PROCESSING.md](https://github.com/adurivault/FBMessage/blob/master/PROCESSING.md)
