# How can I access and transform my conversation history ?

## Create your facebook archive

Facebook allows you to dowload all of your data history , particularly your messages archive. In order to do that :

1. Go to your Facebook account
2. Then click on <b>"Settings"</b>
3. Click <b>General</b> in the lefthand column.
4. Click <b>Download a copy of your Facebook data</b> at the bottom of the General Account Settings page.

Then you have to wait for approximatly 10/15 minutes to receive a email with a link to dowload your data.

Be patient ! Sometimes it can be very long, up to few hours.
